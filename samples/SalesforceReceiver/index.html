    <h1>Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks Salesforce Receiver</h1>

    <p>
        The Salesforce WebHook receiver supports Salesforce SOAP-based Outbound Messages as a WebHook even though it is
        indeed a SOAP message.
    </p>

    <p>A sample WebHook URI is:</p>

    <pre>https://&lt;host&gt;/api/webhooks/incoming/sfsoap/{id}</pre>

    <p>
        For security reasons, the WebHook URI must be an <c>https</c> URI and the '<c>MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_SalesforceSoap</c>'
        application setting must be configured to the Salesforce Organization IDs. The Organizational IDs can be found at
        <a href="https://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> under <c>Setup | Company Profile | Company Information</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Optionally you can use the {id} field to differentiate between multiple WebHooks. You can configure each endpoint by setting
        the <c>MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_SalesforceSoap</c> application setting to contain multiple config values, for example '
        <c>code0, id1=code1, id2=code2</c>'.
    </p>
