    <h1>Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks Visual Studio Team Services Receiver</h1>

    <p>
        The VSTS WebHook Receiver provides support for receiving WebHooks from Visual Studio Team Services. A sample WebHook URI is:</p>

    <pre>https://&lt;host&gt;/api/webhooks/incoming/vsts?code=83699ec7c1d794c0c780e49a5c72972590571fd8</pre>

    <p>
        For security reasons the WebHook URI must be an <c>https</c> URI and contain a 'code' query parameter with the
        same value as configured in the <b>MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_VSTS</b> application setting.
        The 'code' parameter must be between 32 and 128 characters long. Optionally you can use IDs
        to differentiate between multiple WebHooks, for example '<c>code0, id1=code1, id2=code2</c>'. 
    </p>
