# Microsoft ASP.NET Core WebHooks
## Note: This repo is solely for the ASP.NET Core WebHooks projects (libraries to consume WebHooks on ASP.NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0). For ASP.NET WebHooks (targeting .NET Framework 4.5), see the [aspnet/AspNetWebHooks](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebHooks) repo.

AppVeyor: [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/aspnet/webhooks?branch=dev&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/aspnetci/webhooks/branch/dev)

ASP.NET Core WebHooks provide support for receiving WebHooks. The packages depend on [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://github.com/aspnet/mvc).

ASP.NET Core MVC is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
